 * - Stone background (warm beige, --color-bg-secondary)
 * - Centered content (max-width: 900px via --content-narrow)

 * - Body paragraphs: Base 18px (--font-size-md), comfortable line height

    <div class="about__content">
      <p>We build modern web and mobile applications, custom plugins, and the infrastructure that makes platforms work together. Next.js sites, Rails apps, WordPress plugins, iOS apps, integrations between services. Sometimes that's building from scratch, sometimes it's finishing what got stuck. Solid foundations (elemental) crafted with care (sugar). That's the idea, anyway.</p>

      <p>Founded by Tami Mitchell, who's spent 13 years going deep on whatever the project needs. Legacy Rails apps that needed gentle refactoring. Enterprise CMS migrations with 246 blog posts to wrangle. Live broadcast overlays for off-road rallies. Neurodivergent-friendly iOS apps. AI-native storytelling automation. Systems that respect actual human capacity.</p>

      <p>We build interfaces that adapt to users, not the other way around. Predictable, calm tech for people who need that. When we use AI, it's practical infrastructure&mdash;like documentation that works for both developers reading it and Claude Code using it as context. Tools that help get work done, not hype or hand-wringing.</p>
