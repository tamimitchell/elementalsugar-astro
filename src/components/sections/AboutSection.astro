      <p>
        We build modern web and mobile applications, custom plugins, and the
        infrastructure that makes platforms work together. For creators building
        their vision, builders shipping products, and organizations on a mission.
        Sometimes that's building from scratch, sometimes it's finishing what
        got stuck. Solid foundations (elemental) crafted with care (sugar).
        That's the idea, anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        We build interfaces that adapt to users, not the other way around. Calm,
        predictable technology that respects human capacity: energy levels, attention
        spans, the need for quiet tech. Neurodivergent-friendly design isn't a
        feature, it's the foundation. When we use AI, it's practical infrastructure,
        tools that help get work done, not hype or hand-wringing.
      </p>

        Founded by Tami Mitchell, bringing 13 years of specialized depth to what
        each development project needs. Whether it's migrating a blog with hundreds of posts,
        building a neurodivergent-friendly iOS app, or connecting systems that
        weren't meant to talk, it's all about making technology work with people,
        not against them.
