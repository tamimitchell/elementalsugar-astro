/**
 * AboutSection.astro
 *
 * Placeholder for the "About Elemental Sugar" section.
 * Will be replaced with full implementation in Phase 3.
 *
 * Design direction:
 * - Stone background (--color-bg-secondary)
 * - 100vh full viewport height, vertically centered
 * - Clean centered layout (max-width: 900px)
 * - Text-centered, 2-3 paragraphs
 * - No boxes, no borders, no lists
 * - Feels like a closing statement, not a resume
 *
 * This placeholder provides:
 * - Correct section ID and aria attributes
 * - Stone background treatment
 * - Viewport-height centering
 * - Representative about content from content-architecture.md

        We build modern web and mobile applications, custom plugins, and the
        infrastructure that makes platforms work together. Solid foundations
        (elemental) crafted with care (sugar).

        Founded by Tami Mitchell, who's spent 13 years going deep on whatever
        the project needs. Legacy Rails apps, enterprise CMS migrations, live
        broadcast overlays, neurodivergent-friendly iOS apps, and AI-native
        storytelling automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We build interfaces that adapt to users, not the other way around.
        Predictable, calm tech for people who need that.
