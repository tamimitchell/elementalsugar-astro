/**
 * ContactSection.astro
 *
 * "Work Together" contact section with background photography and glass card.
 * Migrated from Next.js ContactSection to Astro with proper BEM styling.
 *
 * Content source: docs/softforge-links/content-architecture.md
 * Design source: Next.js ContactSection.tsx + ContactSection.scss (source of truth)
 *
 * Layout:
 * - 100vh full viewport height, vertically centered (section--viewport)
 * - Colorado mountain background image (local, lazy loaded)
 * - Pine gradient glass card, right-aligned on desktop, centered on mobile
 * - Card max-width 600px with generous padding
 *
 * Typography:
 * - Section heading: Comfortaa 700, gradient-text-light (heading-1 class)
 * - Body paragraphs: body-text-lg, parchment at 90% opacity
 * - Email link: body-text-lg, iris underline with hover transition
 *
 * Accessibility:
 * - Semantic section with aria-labelledby
 * - Proper heading hierarchy (h2 within main)
 * - High contrast: parchment on pine card (10.2:1, exceeds WCAG AA 4.5:1)
 * - Focus-visible states on interactive elements
 * - Large tap target for email link (mobile friendly)
 * - Background image has descriptive alt text
 *
 * Performance:
 * - Background image self-hosted (no external requests, no third-party tracking)
 * - Background image lazy loaded (below the fold)
 * - No JavaScript required (pure CSS layout)
 * - backdrop-filter with @supports fallback
 *
 * Styles: src/styles/components/contact.css
